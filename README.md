# Internet Of Things(IoT) Project Outline

A collection of Internet of Things(IoT) projects utilizing an arduino uno, jumpwires, thermoresistors, a breadboard, batteries, and various sensors to simulate hardware and software integration. Please refer to the outline below to see the hardware utilized and project goal/results. Your results may vary depending on your computer's hardware. 
#### To run the projects below you'll need:
  * Hardware components listed per project
  * Arduino's open-source IDE software (utilized v. 1.8.16)

## Project #1: Temperature Sensor
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 100k Ohm Resistor (Note: Any resistor should do, but must be accounted for in the code's calculations) 
  * Jumpwires

## Project #2: Validating Properties of Thermistors
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 100k Ohm Resistor (Note: Any resistor should do, but must be accounted for in the code's calculations) 
  * Jumpwires

## Project #3: Storing Sensory Data to SD Card
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 100k Ohm Resistor (Note: Any resistor should do, but must be accounted for in the code's calculations) 
  * Jumpwires

## Project #4: Recording Frequencies of an SD Card
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 100k Ohm Resistor (Note: Any resistor should do, but must be accounted for in the code's calculations) 
  * Jumpwires

## Project #5: Voltage Sensor
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 10k Ohm Resistor (Note: Issues recording data from voltage sensor & thermistor simultaneously utilizing a 100k Ohm & switched to a 10k Ohm resistor. This resolved issue but unable to confirm if due individual resistor or type)
  * Jumpwires

## Project #6: Verifying Thermistor Resistance with the Thermistor Voltage 
#### Project Goal:

#### Hardware Utilized:
  * Arduino Uno & USB cable
  * Breadboard
  * 10k Ohm Resistor (Note: Issues recording data from voltage sensor & thermistor simultaneously utilizing a 100k Ohm & switched to a 10k Ohm resistor. This resolved issue but unable to confirm if due individual resistor or type)
  * Jumpwires
